# ResoBlending – Blender Add-on for Resonite

**ResoBlending** is an experimental Blender add-on that aims to bridge  
**Resonite ↔ Blender** using **ResoniteLink (WebSocket / JSON API)**.

The goal of this project is to enable **live or semi-live data exchange**
between Resonite worlds and Blender scenes for development, prototyping,
and tooling purposes.

⚠️ **Project status:** early development / proof of concept  
This add-on is **not production-ready** and may change structure at any time.
